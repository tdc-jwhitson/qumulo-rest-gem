module Qumulo::Rest::V1

  # == Class Description
  # This resource is used to log in a client using :username and :password
  # attributes. After post, it will contain the :key to sign requests afterwards.
  #
  # == Notes
  # This is a non-standard REST resource, in that, the attributes used in POST,
  # namely, :username and :password, are different from the attributes returned
  # in a server response, namely, :key and :key_id. But, that's OK. We don't want
  # to keep around :username and :password in our login session object.
  #
